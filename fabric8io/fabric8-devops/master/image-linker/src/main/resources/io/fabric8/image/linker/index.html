<h1>Image Linker</h1>

<p>This little microservice helps you view images inline inside letschat and other simple chat clients which just use the URL extension to determine if it should be inlined</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>/http/host/port/q/foo=bar/path.png</b> to view the link http://host:port/path?foo=bar as a png inside chat where the query is embedded inside the path so that the chat client is more likely to think its a png ;)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>/http/host/port/p/path.png?foo=bar</b> to view the link http://host:port/path?foo=bar as a png inside chat
  </li>
</ul>
