  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at

  # notification.

  # terminate the search and the alert will be inserted at that routing node.
  # If true, the alert is inserted to sibling nodes as well if there is a

  # This allows to do first-match semantics (=false) in smaller scopes (e.g. team-level),
  # while avoiding accidental shadowing (=true) at alerts at larger scopes (e.g. company-level)
